The application has a Dark and a Light theme, which appear as shown below.

User's can change themes easily. They can also generate colors from County's flags using the Palette. This is EXPERIMENTAL and might not work perfectly well!

The users can also modify cards location by pinning them to the top, or unpinning them and by deleting them also!

The app updates real time currency rates, and shows if the currency is gaining or loosing on the Home Screen, on each card the user has created!

As shown in the above image, you can see the gain and the loss using the red and green drawables that make it easy to distinguish how the currency is comparing to the crypto currencies in real time!

### Currency Conversion
The users can easily convert currencies by selecting the amount. They can switch between Bitcoin and Ethereum easily. The app also shows history for the last 5 days! Bonus!
